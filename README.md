CMB-GAN
=======


CMB-GAN is a package to fill what we missed in Cosmic Microwave Backround.

**Important**
I did not find a chance to make it like a package, sorry if the codes are a bit confusing. Don't hesitate to ask if there was any problem, question, etc.

**CMB-GAN** is a flexible and expendable inpaintation code for CMB data.
